  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    Programming is my passion, and I also enjoy sharing 
    my knowledge and experience with others. 
    I am always curious about new technologies and how they can improve 
    our lives and work.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to keep on growing as a developer. 
    I want to share some of the tips and resources that have helped me 
    grow as a developer - and hopefully, they can help you too!
